description: Discover the Unreal Engine Cinematic FBX workflow with our comprehensive tutorial. Our guide provides practical examples and best practices for importing and exporting FBX files, creating stunning cinematics, and improving your game development workflow. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, our step-by-step instructions will help you master the techniques needed to create cinematic-quality content for Unreal Engine.

## Introduction

How do we transfer assets and animation to Unreal needed for cinematic? 
.fbx is the way to go (at least for now). 
For each component of a cinematic, we want to set it up nicely so the data can be
correctly presented in Unreal.

However, do note there are limitations in .fbx and differences between DCCs, certain
things just can't be transferred through .fbx and certain things can't be represented
in Unreal. Always test your workflow before going into full scale production.

Please refer to [Unreal's FBX Content Pipeline](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/fbx-content-pipeline/)

## General

The important thing to keep in mind is that **consistency is king**,
we want to have consistent world unit, identify coordinate system for each DCC,
and maintain a hierarchy standard for assets across DCCs.

Certain workflow involves animating or placing components
within Unreal instead of importing outside the engine which is totally fine.

## Static Mesh

Static Meshes represents anything that is not animated, like a background environment. 
There shouldn't be any keys on any of the transforms or attribute. 
They are meant to be modeled outside Unreal,
and imported as a static mesh asset, placed in the level as a static mesh actor.

  </tr>
</table>

### Export:

In the outliner, select all the meshes and export as .fbx

![flag-sm-hierarchy](https://i.imgur.com/xe9MfeN.png)

### Import:

Make sure 'combine mesh' is checked, otherwise the asset will be imported as separate meshes (probably not
what we want)

We have three types of Unreal assets created: Static Mesh, Textures and Materials.

### Static Mesh Animation

If a mesh is animated in any capacity, even if it's just translating or rotating as a whole
without any deformation, it needs to be skinned with joint(s). Consider this as a common standard.

See the process of Skeletal Mesh in the immediate following.

Note: the joint transform pivot needs to be align with the mesh transform pivot.

**Example:**

Take a look at our previous flag prop. If we want to animate the flag like moving it around in Unreal,
it needs to have joint hierarchy where we can apply animation to, even if it's simple as this.
Applying animation directly to transform is not recommended.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GA2NbrO.png" alt="flag-skm-maya" width="300px">

Also, no need to worry about the extra joint and weight data added, the file size increase
is negligible (<10%).

## Skeletal Mesh (SKM)

Skeletal Mesh could be used to represent an animated foreground prop or environment,
or something as complicated as a character/creature.

**Example:**

<table style="width: 800px">
  <tr>
    <td>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/S4AeH4B.png" alt="char-rig-maya" height="300px">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Export

[Rigging in Game vs Animation](https://discourse.techart.online/t/rigging-in-game-vs-animation/2490)

A complex animation rig can't translate 1 to 1 to game engine, the rigging phase needs
to be planned to accommodate the limitation of the engine.

Once we have a suitable rig in Maya, we need to prepare it for the engine.
We would clean the rig up to get a desired hierarchy which contains only joints
and meshes. So remove components like controllers and constraints, also get rid
of any redundant namespace.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4PupBE3.png" alt="char-skm-outline" width="200px">

### Import

In addition to Textures and Materials, we have three major components imported:
Skeleton, Skeletal Mesh and Physics Asset.

- Skeleton: refers the joint hierarchy, it uses the Skeletal Mesh as the preview mesh
- Skeletal Mesh: is the Skinned Mesh along with the Skeleton
- Physics Asset: defines physics and collision used by the Skeletal Mesh (sometimes
even rendering), a rough physics collision body is defined during import.

  <tr>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Skeletal Mesh Animation

> The exported animation should maintain the exact same hierarchy structure of the exported rig

Generally, the root of the rig/skeleton, whether it's a transform group or a 
root joint, should not have animation/keyed data on it, 
as it is generally used to offset world transform 
(and keyed transform can't do that)

### Export

Since keyframes are usually on controllers, so we have to bake the keys on all joints.

Select the joint hierarchy and Bake Simulation, after that we can get rid of the controllers
and constraints just like what we did during the rig clean up.

This time, we only need to export the joint hierarchy (no meshes).

### Blend Shape

Unreal supports blend shapes, if you need to export blend shape animation,
additional steps needs to be done.

1. find all meshes with blend shape node attached
2. traverse in the node editor and locate the blend shape node
3. bake simulation on the blend shape node
4. include these meshes (ones with blend shape) during the export process

### Import (as Animation Sequence)

Now during import phase simply select the Skeleton Unreal asset that matches 
your animation, no need to create a new Skeletal Mesh.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ez1x8Zv.png" alt="ue-anim-outline" height="300px">

An Animation Sequence Unreal asset is now created, you can also see a preview
mesh through the Editor window. It is now ready to be used in the Sequencer.

## Camera Animation

Maya Camera cannot be imported as an Unreal asset.
Unreal has its own native Camera object, which is not 1-to-1 match to Maya's Camera.

What we can do is export Maya camera's animation and attribute and
import on an Unreal Cinematic Camera Actor.

See video guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtxLmWquOOY)

### Export

The camera node has to be on the scene root, with no transform node on top.
Otherwise, the animation wonâ€™t be imported correctly as Unreal is searching
for the top node.

### Import (as Keyframes)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XOkzVrx.png" alt="cam-import-option" width="300px">

Cameras are linked to the game viewport, therefore animation import needs to be plotted on
the Sequencer as individual keyframes instead of being an Unreal asset.

Create a camera track and bind it to a newly created Unreal CineCameraActor and
hit 'Import'.

## Maya FBX Export Option Reference

[FBX Export options: Full Help](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2022/ENU/Maya-Basics/files/GUID-FE8DBEAA-C2DD-43B3-9933-4BA4CDDEAA89-htm.html)

Embed Media:
- Could be **checked** during Static Mesh/Skeletal Mesh export based on needs,
the Unreal import can pick up the texture and materials embedded.

Smoothing Group:
- Usually needs to be **checked** so Unreal can use the smoothing group exported
from Maya as opposed to perform smoothing calculation on Unreal side.

Include Children:
- Almost always keep **unchecked**, and explicitly select nodes to export.

Input Connections:
- Keep **unchecked** is usually a good idea to avoid exporting extra data, but
also depends on different circumstances

Deformed Models:
- For Skeletal Mesh export which is commonly a rig, check "Skins" to export
skin deformation like skin clusters, check "Blend Shapes" to export all blend shape
targets.
- For Skeletal Mesh **Animation** export, uncheck "Skins" and "Blend Shapes".
Skinning data is embedded within the Skeletal Mesh Asset in Unreal, and for
blend shapes, as long as you are following this [step](#blend-shape), 
the imported .fbx would also carry over blend shape animation.

Bake Animation:
- Leave this **unchecked** and use Maya's _Edit | Keys | Bake Simulation_, as it
offers more flexible solutions and is also generally much faster.
